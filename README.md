I am a computer science student with a focus on data science at Oregon State University (expected graduation June 2022). I love to solve software engineering problems and learn more about machine learning.

My technical skills include Python, C++, Javascript, and Django.

I have interned at Intel as a software validation engineer, and was able to build my interpersonal skills, adaptability, and ability to work within a group of software engineers on new and existing projects. I worked on internal tools to help with validation testing and a web project that utilized Python and Django.
